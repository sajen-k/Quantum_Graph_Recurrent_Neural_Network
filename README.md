# Quantum_Graph_Recurrent_Neural_Network
Implementation of Quantum Graph Recurrent Neural Network (QGRNN).
This demonstration investigates quantum graph recurrent neural networks (QGRNN), which are the quantum analogue of a classical graph recurrent neural network, and a subclass of the more general quantum graph neural network ansatz. Both the QGNN and QGRNN were introduced in this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12264
